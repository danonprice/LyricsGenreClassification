    "\n",
    "In the field of Natural Language Processing, the classification of music genres based on the lyrics is a challenging task, we cannot yet fully understand how the human brain does it, but many strides mave been made in understanding language and with that understanding the newer algorithms are able to offer some classifications that can be useful for an organization tryng to do this task at a large scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to explore advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods in the papers we have selected and report our observations, learnings and a recommendation. With the focus of deep learning, it is clear that Neural Networks tend to work better than the previously used models. We would like to explore this path and provide some comparative analysis.\n"

    "A lot of tech organizations, acedemic and industry teams have tried many approaches to this space, they have not been very successful in finding a stable method which would perform significantly well to tackle this problem. SVM, KNN and Naive Bayes have all been used in lyrical classification but they all have very low success with this problem. We would like to try to replicate the research done and find stable ways to offer potential industry partners when faced with a similar problem."
