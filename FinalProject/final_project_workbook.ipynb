    "\"CD sales are plummeting, and vinyl sales have plateaued after rising to their greatest peak since the 1990s, but that doesn't mean that people have stopped listening to music. With the rise of streaming music, people are listening as much as ever, in their homes, offices, or any other location where their devices can connect to the internet.\" - Says PCMag<sup>[1]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify<sup>[2]</sup>, happens to have total market share of over $25 Billion, and is one of the leaders in the music streaming space today. It has millions of songs in its database and claims at its core that it has the right music for everyone. They have invested a lot in research, especially NLP methods, starting with classification of the music based on many factors including tempo, acoustics, energy, danceability etc. to answer that most important and stressful first impression question: What is your favorite type of music?\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies like spotify are surviving based on more and more nuanced music classification, either to be able to place the right recommendations to their customers or simply as a product (for example Shazam). Thus finding out at scale, the music genres is the most fundamental step in moving towards a personal listening experience."

    "\n",
    "Various academic and industry teams have tried approaches to this space. Efforts to understand music, both sonically and semantically through lyrics and metadata, have coalesced in a subfield known as Music Information Retrieval (MIR). No single effort has been very successful in finding a stable method which performs significantly well to tackle the lyrical genre classification problem. SVM, KNN and Naive Bayes have all been used in lyrical classification but they all have very low accuracy. We would like to explore the application of new and emerging models to the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of Natural Language Processing, the classification of music genres based on lyrics is a challenging task. Machine understanding of language in general is complex. We cannot yet fully understand how the human brain does it but many strides have been made. With that understanding, newer and emerging algorithms and word embeddings are able to offer classifications useful for organizations doing language tasks at a large scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to explore advantages and disadvantages of several methods in papers we have selected and report our observations, learnings and a recommendation. With the focus of deep learning, it is clear that Neural Networks tend to work better than previously used models. We would like to explore this path and provide some comparative analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this problem is hard to come by  due to copyright and other original content protection requirements. The search for more examples continues, in the meantime we have we found a data set in Kaggle which is suitable to get started with model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial dataset is downloadable as a comma delimited file. The columns in the file are as follows:\n",
    "`index,song,year,artist,genre,lyrics`\n",
    "    \n",
    "We are particularly interested in the text in the lyrics column. However, we may find ways to utilize other columns as features. The lyrics are a string with carriage returns denoting an end of line. Statistics specific to the overall structure of the lyrics, such as line length, may add value to the classification task."

If one is much more likely than the other, predicting the more likely class every time will be accurate at the same rate as the likely class. In the case of this data the prior rates are not given, and the description of the data<sup>[2]</sup> specifically indicates that the classes have been sampled at different rates to change the size of the data set. We cannot hope to recover the initial information.

In this model, a document is denoted by d, a term (token) by t, and the number of documents in a corpus by N. The term frequency tf(t, d) denotes the number of times term t appears in document d.

    "The above ROC curve visualizes how well the model predicts the target. It shows us the trade-off between the false positive rate and true positive rate, as we vary the threshold required to predict a positive outcome. A random model is represented by the dashed line. With full set of features, it is better than random model but it is also not very strong either.  It is also less accuracte than the null rate we would have by guessing \"not-clicked\" every time, of 75%.\n",

    "We have seen above that we have a mostly empty sparse feature set. In this situation, feature hashing is a useful technique for handling sparse, high-dimensional features in this machine learning problem. It is going to allow us to design a fast, simple, memory-efficient, and well-suited Logistical regression model that can be used in this online learning scenario. Below we wil also build the data pipeline using the RDD framework, this will help us demonstrate the distributed nature of the underlying algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of feature hashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Handles sparse data pipelines consistently, irrespective of new categorical values.\n",
    "2) Keeps the overall dimensions to be static-- we can set this-- hence limiting effect of sparsity.\n",
    "3) Computationally very efficient, we can predict now using the number of rows the time and space complexity of the algorithm"

    "The mapper function calculates the gradient. Based on equation (2), the gradient is just an updated vector $x_i$ with scalar. Since we use the sparse vector representation, we only need to multiply the scalar to the one hot values of the $x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the gradient step, there is a step to sum over all sparse vectors over all data points. This step turns out to be very challenging to optimize. First, we tried the Spark built-in function `mean()`, but the computation time is too long. Then, we wrote several specialized functions for adding these sparse vectors that yield limited improvements. Finally, we applied `aggregate` function and let `numpy` perform the vector summation. Our last approach improved the run time by 100 times. However, when we compare with the native `Scala` implementation, our `python` based approach is still about 6 times slower.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a ROC curve the false positive rate is plotted as a function of the true positive rate (Sensitivity) for different cut-off points of a parameter. The area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups (click/non-click)<sup>[14](https://www.medcalc.org/manual/roc-curves.php)</sup>. We can see that we have a model that has an acceptable level of (online) ability to diagnose and tell our marketing client the probability of a click vs no click.   \n",

    "#### Interpretation of the Recall Vs Precision curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall plot is based on two basic measures – recall and precision -- that are calculated from the four outcomes. The precision-recall plot uses recall on the x-axis and precision on the y-axis. Recall is identical with sensitivity, and precision is identical with positive predictive value. \n",
    "\n",
    "A point of caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saito and Rehmsmeier (2015)<sup>[8](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118432)</sup> found in a literature analysis that ROC curves are very popular, their popularity has been increasing for the last decade, and they are the most widely used evaluation method with imbalanced data. Based on their models for how to compare performance the authors conclude that changing the main evaluation method from ROC to PRC may influence he usefulness of prediction performance measures like ROC or RPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphs presented for the data sets above clearly demonstrate that adding a lot of observations without a click and with low click rate to a model may improve the ROC curve significantly without any improvement in sensitivity or in positive predictive value of the parameter evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall curves will not be impacted by the addition of more observations without a click and with low click rates. Thus it can be highly recommended to use PRC as a supplement to the routinely used ROC curves to get the full picture when evaluating and comparing performance of the model."

    "#### Benchmark A : Spark 2.0 ML implementation summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Our business user ultimately wants a solution that can achieve their goals, while the Data science team can take advantage of the most stable generally available features of Spark that can be handed off the the Dev Ops organization for continued maintenance. From approximately 2015 on, Apache Spark's core development team implemented an umbrella project called Tungsten to overhaul Spark's execution engine<sup>10</sup>. Concurrently, the Catalyst optimizer was introduced in 2015<sup>11</sup> We recognize the following key facts of using Spark's latest ML and DataFrames abstraction libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Ease-of-use of APIs with structure - Although DataFrame structure may limit control in what the Spark program can do with data, it introduces rich semantics and an easy set of domain specific operations that can be expressed as high-level constructs. Most computations, however, can be accomplished with DataFrame's high-level APIs. (it’s much simpler to perform agg, select, sum, avg, map, filter, or groupBy operations than using RDD rows’ data fields.)<sup>[15](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/three-apache-spark-apis-rdds-dataframes-datasets.html)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Performance and Optimization - Along with all the above benefits, we cannot overlook the space efficiency and performance gains in using DataFrames and Dataset APIs for two reasons. First, because DataFrame and Dataset APIs are built on top of the Spark SQL engine, it uses Catalyst to generate an optimized logical and physical query plan. Across R, Java, Scala, or Python DataFrame/Dataset APIs, all relation type queries undergo the same code optimizer, providing the space and speed efficiency. Whereas the Dataset[T] typed API is optimized for data engineering tasks, the untyped Dataset(row) (an alias of DataFrame) is even faster and suitable for interactive analysis.<sup>[16](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/14/a-tale-of-three-apache-spark-apis-rdds-dataframes-and-datasets.html)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Modernization of the framework - The choice of RDD or DataFrame is NOT always easy one. RDD offers low-level functionality and control, the DataFrame allows custom view and structure, high-level and specific operations, saves space, and executes at superior speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we examined in this class, the lessons we learned from early releases of Hadoop streaming, RDDs\n",
    "  — how to simplify Spark for developers, how to optimize and make it performant\n",
    "  — we decided to elevate the low-level RDD APIs to a high-level abstraction as DataFrame and Dataset and to build this unified data abstraction across  libraries atop Catalyst optimizer and Tungsten.<sup>[18](https://datalere.com/databricks/5-things-to-know-about-databricks/)</sup>\n",
    "  - Spark has been historically difficult to tune and maintain. That makes it very hard to ensure performance so that it doesn’t buckle under heavy data loads.  If the cluster isn’t expertly managed, this can negate “the Good” aspects fast.\n",
    "  - PySpark UDFs are much slower and more memory-intensive than Scala and Java UDFs are. \n",
    "  - The performance skew towards Scala and Java is noticeable and appreciated, since Spark is written in Scala and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).<sup>[19](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-using-Spark-in-Scala-and-Python)</sup> \n",
    "  - Python UDFs require moving data from the executor’s JVM to a Python interpreter, which is very slow. If Python UDF performance is problematic, Spark does enable a user to create Scala UDFs, which can be run in Python. However, this slows down development time and was beyond the scope of this project.<sup>[17](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-pyspark-pandas-with-arrow.html)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Summary,\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Spark has released DataFrames and DataSets abstractions. They have also added several specific base algorithms in the machine learning libraries (MLlib and ML) and improved performance. Unfortunately, enterprises that need business continuity will be cautious to upgrade to more complex engineering centric solution creating a major bottleneck due to a constant need for highly skilled data engineers and Spark data scientists. As data scientists, we have had to cope with working on the Hadoop stream, then RDD and finally the DataFrames paradigm, making the progress to become faster and lot of error prone details to be abstracted out.<sup>[20](https://thenewstack.io/the-good-bad-and-ugly-apache-spark-for-data-science-work/)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose that for this project, we keep in mind that a model that is less complex, has greater parsimony, utilizes a framework that allows faster go-to-market and above all a distributed computing environment that is less prone to errors and resilient to the elastic nature of Big data challenges, is the key to success.\n"

    "k-fold cross validation is a well established approach to reduce model bias and variance. The approach trains a model iteratively k-times by dividing data into k datasets, holding out the k<sup>th</sup> set for testing and using the rest for training. Bias is reduced by ensuring each data point is in test set exactly one time while the model error is computed across all k trials.<sup>[22]</sup>  \n",
    "\n",
    "K-Fold cross validation takes the following steps<sup>[23]</sup>:\n",
    "1.\tShuffle the dataset randomly.\n",
    "2.\tSplit the dataset into k groups\n",
    "3.\tFor each unique group:  \n",
    "    3.1.\tTake the group as a hold out or test data set  \n",

    "4.\tSummarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this approach however is the time it takes to train the model. Since the model executes k times, model training can take a very long time. As such, below execution was performed only on the sample dataset. The full dataset execution did not complete despite training on cluster node setup for 24 hours. This execution was terminated due to resource cnstraints."

    "\n",
    "__{This section needs to be updated to reflect a list of all the things we tried and what we learned]__\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project we sought to implement a scalable solution with consideration to the business context.  Logistic regression was chosen as a solution known to scale well, with desirable characteristics due to the linear nature of its underlying formulation, which would translate to roughly linear time complexity and the ability to scale out effectively in a distributed environment.  With regularization it becomes an extension of ridge or LASSO regression, with all the desirable properties thereof in a distributed framework.  Logistic regression also has an explainable formulation and can be fitted with gradient descent, so solution convergence can be tuned according to known hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided challenges related to feature sparsity. With logistic regression categorical features must be converted to a numerical interpretation.  One-hot-encoding the feature set could not provide a scalable solution due to the combinatorics associated with large numbers of categories per feature, and we therefore chose to hash the feature set.  The feature hash mapped the feature set to a bounded space, provided a framework for handling unseen data per feature, and could be tuned either to map each feature individually to a new space (as in our homegrown solutions), or to map the entire feature set as a whole to a new space, as with Spark's built-in hash.  The former would allow for further feature selection or the ability to drop features providing minimal information, while the latter allows the usage of all information and a fast implementation.  One drawback is that hashing adds an additional hyperparameter, the size of the new space, which could require tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm was developed atop the RDD API, using the map/reduce paradigm, allowing for control of each detail of the implementation, but at a cost of speed vs. either the Spark MLLib  or ML implementation. In the case of MLLib, we lose efficiency due to Python being slower than Scala.  In the case of the ML library, further improvements by the Apache Spark project to the query optimizer mean still further gains in speed, considerably outpacing our implementation, but at the cost of less transparency to the inner workings of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a useful control against overfitted models, we built the implementation with the ability to apply and tune regularization.  While the default Spark implementation allows for $L_1$ or $L_2$ regularization we have only included $L_2$ for now.  We did not explore tuning the regularization hyperparameter, but it provides an important control against possible bias associated with using a large number of features.\n",
